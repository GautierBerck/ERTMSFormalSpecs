>Procedures: A procedure defines the required reaction of the ERTMS/ETCS entities (subsystems and components) to either information exchanged between ERTMS/ETCS entities or events (triggered by external entities or internal events). The procedures focus on the required change in status and mode of the described ERTMS/ETCS entities.</Paragraph><Paragraph

When a transition refers to a driver&apos;s selection, it means that the conditions to enable the corresponding button on the DMI were fulfilled.

</ReqRef>When performing a SoM or a Train Trip procedure and when the current level is 2 or 3, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment can receive a mode profile giving an On Sight area which the train has already entered with its max safe front end. In this case, the ERTMS/ETCS on-board equipment shall first require an acknowledgement from the driver.</Paragraph><Paragraph

>Note: In an On Sight area there is no guarantee for the RBC that the track in front of the supervised train is free. Therefore, if the next block section is free, the RBC has nevertheless to ensure that there is no train/vehicle between the train and the end of the On Sight area. This information
	- can be given to the RBC by the signalman or any other trackside means (outside scope of ERTMS/ETCS), or
	- can be inquired by the RBC by means of the following mechanism: the RBC sends a &quot;track ahead free&quot; request which the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment displays to the driver. If the driver confirms that the track is free up to the end of the current section, the ERTMS/ ETCS on-board equipment will transmit this information to the RBC.</Paragraph><Paragraph

If, when entering the Limited Supervision mode, the train speed was higher than the LS mode speed limit (because a higher speed was allowed in Full Supervision mode, On Sight mode or in Staff Responsible mode) then an emergency brake command could be immediately triggered, independently of the acknowledgement of the driver, but because of the LS supervision (see Figure 21).</Paragraph><Paragraph
