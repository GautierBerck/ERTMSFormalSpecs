>Main ERTMS/ETCS on-board functions:
	- The train reads Eurobalises and sends its position relative to the detected balises to the radio block centre.
	- The train monitors train integrity (external function, not part of ERTMS/ETCS) and sends this information to the radio block centre.
	- The train receives a movement authority and the track description via Euroradio relating to a balise.
	- Selection of the most restrictive value of the different speeds permitted at each location ahead.
	- Calculation of a dynamic speed profile, taking into account the train running/braking characteristics which are known on-board and the track description data.
	- Comparison of the train speed with the permitted speed and commanding of the brake application if necessary.
	- Cab signalling to the driver.</Paragraph></Sub>
